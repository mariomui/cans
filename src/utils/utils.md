* A Utility class is understood to only have static methods and be stateless. You would not create an instance of such a class.
  * Math.pow() for example
* A Helper can be a utility class or it can be stateful or require an instance be created.
  * for example

For server stuff, it shoudl all be kept in the same utils folder, it's not like spliting things into modules is needed.
What we want is flatter structures.
utils/addTwoNumbers.js is kindah crazy.
Eventually you knwo you are gonna have to put that into something.

What i suggest is to do utils/math.js, then export MATH out to an index.js

The user would be export
in the math.js file
export function addTwoNumbers
in the index file
export * as Math from './math.js'
In the index file you could have some random stuff that doesnt belong to math like isNullOrFalse

so now anyone who wants the utils stuff coudl just have it like so
{ Math , isNullOrFalse, etc }

Lets say we move Math into its own folder.
export * as Math from "./subdirector/math.js
this doesnt disrupt math at all.
if we had imported {Math} from './utils/math.js then every single one import would need to change.

Also, if we were swapping v1 and v2.
export * as MathNew from './mathnew.js'
import { MathNew as Math } from './utils

Math.addTwoNumbers()
api still stays the same. we can also gradually migrate the older components to use the new MathNew one at a time. without renaming anything.

if a component uses Math.minusNumbers but needs the new version of addTwoNumbers. we can use a bridge
in the utils.index.js , we create a MathBridge which would then be
import *as Mathnew from './Mathnew.js
import* as Math from './math.js
export const MathBridge =  { ...Math,...Mathnew }
export {Math, Mathnew}
now you can have Mathbridge with all the functions of the old, but any thing mathbridge woudl overwrite would be okay.
-----

export default XXX;
import straightupXXX from ''
(you wouldnt be able to destructure so avoid default anything unless its a major big component);
