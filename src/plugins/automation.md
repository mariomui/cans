# Create_a_node-js_server (CANS)

## Why I chose this stack

* Plop is solely for scaffolding
* I did not need to build a full fledged clide with scoping (oclif)
* execa and listr are transferable command skills should we upgrade to oclif or raw inquirer.
* Plops is extensible and easily publishable as a cli.

## Planning

* Core
  * execa
    * used to execute scripts or node child process.
  * listr
    * Show tasks of long chained tasks
  * Plop
    * create folders and files

## RoadMap

* [ ] **V1**
  * [ ] **Milestones**
    * [ ] working prototype with no major changes to dependencies
    * [ ] use in a work project
    * [ ] use in a hackathon
* [ ] **V2**
