# Create_a_node-js_server (CANS)

* execa
  * used to execute scripts or node child process.
  * node npm install maybe?
* listr used to do terminal processes

## Why I chose this stack

* Plop is solely for scaffolding
* I did not need to build a full fledged clide with scoping (oclif)
* execa and listr are transferable command skills should we upgrade to oclif or raw inquirer.
* Plops is extensible and easily publishable as a cli.
